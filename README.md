# Project Overview

Inspired by OpenAI's Hide-and-Seek [paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1909.07528), we sought to train teams of agents to play tactical 5v5 shooters (e.g. Valorant, CS:GO). Turns out, training takes compute power that we didn't have on our personal laptops. We narrowed the scope and instead applied what we learned from class to the Godot environment, with the help of Ed Beeching's Godot RL Agents toolkit (after determining that our laptops could not run Unity efficiently either).

To run the Godot files and replicate the training yourself, I'd recommend first going through tutorial projects on the Godot RL Agents Github page [here](https://github.com/edbeeching/godot_rl_agents). If you'd like a glimpse at what we were able to accomplish, our final report is included as well.

Overall, we were happy to apply the theory we had learned in class to a custom game, albeit not to the fullest extent we had hoped for.
